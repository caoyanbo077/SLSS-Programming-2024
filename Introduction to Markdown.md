To make a list we use the following: 

* this is the first item in the list
* This is the second
    * This is actually a subpoint in this list

- this is also a list 
    - you can also use sublists with dashes

1. This is the first item in an ordered list
2. monke
    1. This os a sublist
    * Unordred list
