The closest competitors to chess.com are lichess.org and chessbase.com. These online platforms also offer online chess playing capabilities. However, they are not as well known as ches.com. This is because the Chess.com's website is extremely begineer friendy and allows new players to immediately experience the game of chess.

-  There is both a paid and free version of chess.com. The paid verson includes a vast amount of lessons, daily puzzles and chess bots that you can play against. However, the free version already gives you the access to match up against strangers or your friends in chess. 
-  In addition to traditional chess, Chess.com offers various chess variants such as Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess), Three-Check, Crazyhouse, and Bughouse. These variants add excitement and variety to the chess-playing experience.
